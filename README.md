## StarLeague Part 1

### About
I took the [StarLeague gold](https://starleague.us/usaco-gold-training-course) part 1 over the summer in 2021. It was a full day camp with Pudak Nurberdiyev. We would learn about a consept in the morning then code and discuss a few problems for the rest of the day.

This is a submodule in the [USACO repository](https://github.com/asubramanian08/USACO) [training folder](https://github.com/asubramanian08/USACO/tree/master/Training). Every [USACO](http://usaco.org/) problem that is done here is displayed as a txt file in the [USACO repository](https://github.com/asubramanian08/USACO).

### Format
Every lesson broken down with folders and files within it (will be specified later). There is usually one lesson per day but there could be two. The naming system of a lesson is the day number followed by a '-Topic'. If there are multiple lessons in that day, instead of the day number there will be the 'day number.lesson number of that day'.

**In each lesson folder there are:**
* Whiteboard notes: the notes that the teacher writes in class (WB_Notes)
* Lecture: These are prepared before class and don't necessarily contain solutions to the problems asked. (Lecture)
* Questions: A folder with all the questions asked from that lecture (Questions)
* My Solutions: A folder with all of my solutions from that lecture (MySols)
* Teacher Solutions: A folder with all of the teacher's solutions from that lecture (TeacherSols)
* Problem Descriptions: A file that contains the descriptions (name, there the question is from, method to solve) of each problem asked (ProbDescriptions)
