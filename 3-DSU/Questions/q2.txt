Largest Component (Starleague Training Problem)

Calculate the size of the largest connected component of a growing graph with N (1 <= N <= 10,000) nodes. At the 
beginning graph has no edges. The M (0 <= M <= 10,000) edges will be added one by one. Print the size of the 
largest connected component after adding each edge.

INPUT FORMAT (file component.in):
Line 1: N and M
Line 2: N space separated unique integers denoting ID's of the nodes. 
Line 3 to M+2: Two integers u and v (-1000,000,000 <= u, v <= 1000,000,000 and u != v) representing an edge 
between the node u and node v. There is no duplicate edge.

OUTPUT FORMAT (file component.out):
Line 1 to M: Line i contains an integer that that is the size of the largest connected component after adding 
edge i.
