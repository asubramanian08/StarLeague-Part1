Cycle Detection (Starleague Training Problem)

A cycle in a graph is a non-empty trail in which the only repeated vertices are the first and last vertices.

Make a program to determine if a graph with N (1 <= N <= 100,000) and M (1 <= M  <= 100,000) has a cycle. There 
is no parallel edge and self-loop in the graph. One edge may appear several times in the input.


INPUT FORMAT (file cycle.in):

Line 1: N and M
Line 2 to M+1: Two integer u and v; there is a direct connection between u and v (1 <= u, v <= N).


OUTPUT FORMAT (file cycle.out):

"YES" or "NO".


SAMPLE INPUT
