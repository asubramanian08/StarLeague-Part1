Chess Teams (Starleague Training Problem)

On long Cowid-19 days, Farmer John's cows spend their time playing chess. The cows created two chess teams 
"Barley" and "oat" for a new tournament. Some cows joined to team Barley and some cows to team Oat.

In the tournament some cows from two different teams play N (1 <= N <= 10,000) chess games. In each game one of 
the cows is selected from team Barley and the other cow is selected from team Oat.

Each cow has a unique ID between 1 and 1000,000,000. The list of all the games is available. Calculate at most 
how many cows can be member of the larger team.
