Hospital and Fire Station (Starleague Training Problem)

Farmer John's cows often get sick. FJ decided to build a hospital on the farm to give his cows a better health 
service. While entering the construction business, he also wants to build a fire station. It is necessary to be 
prepared for a fire that can occur at any moment.

There are N (1 <= N <= 500) barns numbered from 1 to N on the farm. Barns are connected with M (0 <= M <= 10000) 
bidirectional roads. There can be parallel roads and one road can connect a barn to itself. Some barns may not be 
reachable from some other barns.

The hospital and fire station will be built in a place with existing barns. The two can be in the same place or 
in different places.

Both the hospital and the fire station should serve as many barns as possible. In addition this condition, when 
choosing a hospital location, the sum of the shortest paths from other barns to the hospital should be minimum. 
When choosing a fire station, the longest of the shortest paths to the fire station should be the minimum.

Calculate the list of barns where the hospital can be constructed and the list of barns where the fire station 
can be constructed.

INPUT FORMAT (file hosfire.in)
Line 1: N and M
Line 2 ... M+1: Three integers representing a road. u, v and d. There is a bidirectional road between the barn u 
and barn v with the distance d (1 <= d <= 10,000)

Sample Input:
7 8
1 2 10
2 3 5
3 4 5
4 3 10
5 3 5
5 5 15
6 7 10
7 6 1

OUTPUT FORMAT (file hosfire.out)
Line 1: List of barns where the hospital can be constructed. This list should be printed in increasing order.
Line 2: List of barns where the fire station can be constructed. This list should be printed in increasing order.

Sample Output:
3
