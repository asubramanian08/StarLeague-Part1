New Roads (Starleague Training Problem)

Farmer John plan to construct the roads between his N (1 <= N <= 5000) barns. 

Each barn i is described by a distinct point (xi, yi) in the 2D plane, with 0 <= xi, yi <= 10,000.  The cost of 
building a road between two barns i and j is equal to the Manhatthan distance between them: 

abs(xi - xj) + abs(yi - yj)

FJ would like to build a minimum-length system of roads so that all of his barns are connected together -- so 
that cows in any barn can use a sequence of roads to visit any other barn. However, FJ doesn't want cows in close 
barns to form a clique. Therefore, the length of the road between any two barns should be at least ( 1 <= L <= 
1000).

Please help FJ compute the total minimum length of roads to connect all his barns together. The road between two 
barns can pass through the location of another barn.

INPUT FORMAT
Line 1: N and L.
Lines 2..1+N: Line i+1 contains the integers xi and yi. 

OUTPUT FORMAT
The minimum length of roads connecting the barns, or -1 if no such network of road can be constructed.
