Relay Race (Starleague Training Problem)

Farmer John knows that healthy cows are more efficient. For this reason, he organizes different sports activities 
for his cows. There are (1 <= N <= 100,000) cows in the farm. For today's activity cows are having a relay race. 
Of course, the rules of this race are arranged according to the cows.

The competition is held on an L (1 <= L <= 200,000) length running track. Each cow participates in the race in a 
specific part of the track. Each cow waits at the starting point of its part. Any position can be either start or 
ending position of a single cow.

Any of the cows may start the race running with carrying the baton. The cow she carries the baton gives it to a 
cow whose starting point is between her starting point and her ending point, and whose end point is after her end 
point. 

The contest comes to an end when a cow cannot find another cow to give her the baton.

FJ wants to know at most how many pairs of cows can pass the baton one to another among all cows?

INPUT FORMAT
Line 1: N
Line 2 ... N+1: Each line i+1 describes starting and ending points for cow i with two integers ai and bi (ai < bi 
and 1 <= ai, bi <= L).

OUTPUT FORMAT
A single integer describing number of pairs of cows, modulo 10^9 + 7,  one may pass the baton to the other one.

SAMPLE INPUT:
4
3 20
8 30
4 9
5 10

SAMPLE OUTPUT:
4

OUTPUT 1 DETAILS
(3,20) and (8, 30)
(4, 9) and (5, 10)
(4, 9) and (8, 30)
(5, 10) and (8, 30)
