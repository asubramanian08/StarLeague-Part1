Dividing the Farm (Starleague Training Problem)

There are N (2 <= N <= 4000) pastures connected with M (1 <= M <= 5000) bidirectional roads in Farmer John's farm. 
Pastures are conveniently numbered 1 ... N. It is always possible to travel between any two pastures.

Since driving lots of cows in the pastures is hard work, Farmer John wants to block one of the roads and split 
pastures into two parts. At the same time he wants to minimize the difference of the total capacities of those 
two parts.

What is the minimum difference Farmer John can obtain?

INPUT FORMAT (file divide.in)
Line 1: N and M.
Line 2: Space separated N integers representing the capacity of the pastures starting from the the pasture 1. 
Those integers are in the range 1 ... 100.
Line 3 ... M+2: Two integers u and v (1 <= u, v <= N) representing a road between the pasture u and pasture v. 
There can be parallel roads and even one road may connect a pasture to itself.

OUTPUT FORMAT (file divide.out)

An integer that is the possible minimum difference between two parts.
