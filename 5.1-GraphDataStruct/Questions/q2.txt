Painting The Barns (Starleague Training Problem)

There are N (1 <= N <= 20,000) barns in Farmer John's farm. There are M (1 <= M <= 50,000) bidirectional roads 
between some of the barns. There are no parallel roads and there is no road it connects a barn to itself.

FJ will paint all the barns. He made a vote for the choice of colors among the cows. As a result of the vote, two 
colors came to the fore: light green and dark green.

FJ wonders if it is possible to paint all barns using only light green and dark green colors so that neighboring 
barns are not the same color.
