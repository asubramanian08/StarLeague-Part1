Cow Decryption (Starleague Training Problem)

Farmer John always encrypt the files that contain confidential information about his cows like milk production, 
favorite grass etc. He uses a key document to decipher the encrypted files.

The key document contains a list of translations of letters. Some letters may have more than one translation, and 
others may have no translation. He repeatedly applies some of these translations to individual letters in the 
encrypted file for decryption.

Somehow Bessie the cow obtained the encrypted files and the key. She has already deciphered the encrypted file 
word by word.

Help Bessie to verify if the words in each pair match. Two words match if they have the same length and if each 
letter of the first word can be turned into the corresponding letter of the second word by using the available 
translations zero or more times. There are N (1 <= N <= 1000) pairs of translations in the key and M (1 <= M <= 
10,000) words in the document.



INPUT FORMAT

Line 1: N and M

Line 2 ... N+1: Two Space separated lowercase letters a and b. Letter a can be translated to letter b.

Line N+2 ... N + M + 1: Each line contains a word pair to check. Words consist of lowercase letters and each word 
contains at least 1 and at most 20 letters.



OUTPUT FORMAT

For each pair of words, print "NO" if the two words do not match, print "NOT UNIQUE" if the two words do match 
but there can be alternative decryption, print "UNIQUE" if the two words do match and there is a unique 
decryption.
