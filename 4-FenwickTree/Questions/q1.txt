Sleepwalking Cows (Starleague Training)

Farmer John's (FJ) N (1 <= N <= 100,000) cows are sleeping in M (1 <= M <= 100,000) stalls. Cows and stalls are 
conveniently numbered  1 ... N and 1 ... M. Stalls are located side by side.

Farmer John knows in which barn each cow is asleep. Some stalls can be empty and some stalls may contain several 
cows. But the cows start to wander at night and go to other stalls. FJ needs to track the total number of cows in 
a range of stalls to organize the night feeding. Help FJ to determine if total number of cows in a range of stalls 
exceeds a number X in any time when the movements of the cows are known.


INPUT FORMAT

Line 1: N, M, K and X. K is total number of movements and queries.

Line 2: N space separated integers s. si denotes the stall ID where cowi was asleep.

Line 3 to K+2: For updates 0 a b: cow ai moves to stall bi from its current stall. For queries 1 c d: Print total 
number of cows between the stall ci and stall di if the sum > X, ci and di both are inclusive.


OUTPUT FORMAT

An integer for each query if the sum > X.
