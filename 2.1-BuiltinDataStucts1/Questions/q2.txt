Milking Queue (Starleague Training Problem)

Farmer John's N cows (1 <= N <= 10,000), conveniently numbered 1..N, get in line every evening for milking. There 
are M (1 <= M <= 1000) milking machines. Machines are conveniently numbered 1..M.

Cows get served at milking machines by order they got in line. FJ wants to know which cow is served at which 
machine.

INPUT FORMAT (file milking.in)
Line 1: N and M
Line 2 ... 2*N+1: Each line contain a letter ('C' or 'M') and an integer X. "C X" means that cow X gets at the 
back of the line. "M X" means that machine X serves the next cow in front of the line.

OUTPUT FORMAT (file milking.out)
Line 1 ... M: Line i contains the machine id (i) and list of the cows that are served in machine i. Cows should 
be printed in the same order they are served.
